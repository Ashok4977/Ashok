'@primer/react': patch
---

- Inner action's hover bg should not touch the text input edges
- Increases touch target area of the inner action button
- Deprecation: we only want to allow inner action buttons to be icon buttons
- Deprecation: we only want to allow inner action buttons to be the 'invisible' variant
