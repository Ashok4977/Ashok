    <h1>A React component that wraps a custom element and imports its
      definition to its own bundle</h1>

    <p>We want to share components between dotcom and other web applications so
    that they are consistent in implementation and for users. It's likely that
    we will continue to use custom elements on dotcom for the foreseeable
    future, and use React for other github applications. It make sense for us
    to use custom elements open-sourced by GitHub within a React component
    library, and use React to encapsulate the styles along with it, so it's
    worth testing this in practice.</p>
