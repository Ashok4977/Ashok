title: Server-side rendering with Primer React

## SSR-safe ID generation

Some primer components generate IDs for elements that unique and are isomorphic (server-side rendering and client-side rendering are the same). We use [@react-aria/ssr](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ssr.html) to generate those IDs. In client-only rendering, this doesn't require any work. In SSR contexts, you must wrap your application with `<SSRProvider>`:

```
<SSRProvider></SSRProvider>
```

SSRProvider maintains the context necessary to ensure IDs are consistent.
