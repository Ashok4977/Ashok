# ADR 5: Migration plan for deprecated components

## Status

Proposed

## Context

As we work on maturity of our components, we will sometimes need to deprecate components that are replaced with new components.

## Here are the 3 proposed stages:

### Stage 1

Start new component outside the main bundle. Folks who want to try it, need to explicitly import it from the `labs` bundle.

`import { ActionMenu} from '@primer/react/drafts'`

The contract with consumers is - you are opting into a rewrite of the old component that might not cover all the cases of the old component yet. If you are using both the old and new version of the component in different pages, you are paying some additional bundlesize cost.

Note: If it's a 1:1 replacement, it's useful to keep the same name.

### Stage 2

After we have the confidence that this component is better than the old version of it, we swap the components and move the old component out of the main bundle.

This is a breaking change! It’s recommended that you start using the new component, but if you’d like to push that effort to the future, we give you an easy way out -

`import { ActionMenu } from '@primer/react/deprecated'`

The deprecated component does not accept new features requests.

Reason: Because we have a single bundle for all components, you can not pick the components you want to upgrade. This can results in additional unrelated work.

### Stage 3

After 3 months of living in the `deprecated` bundle, a component is retired/deleted from the codebase.

At this point, consumers are expected to plan migration work.

## Relevant components:

Deprecated in favor of Box, ready for stage 2:

1. BorderBox
2. Flex
3. Grid
4. Position

Replaced with newer components

5. Dialog - replaced with Dialog2, ready for stage 2
6. Dialog2 - ready for Stage 2 with rename, already in main bundle
7. Dropdown - replaced with DropdownMenu, ready for stage 2
8. SelectMenu - replaced with SelectPanel?, ready for stage 2
9. SelectPanel - unclear if it should be renamed, already in main bundle

Future deprecations, replaced with newer components

10. ActionList - replaced with ActionList2, need to plan for stage 2
11. ActionList v2 - in drafts bundle, need to plan for stage 2
12. ActionMenu - replaced with ActionList2, need to plan for stage 2
13. ActionList v2 - in drafts bundle, need to plan for stage 2
14. Button - replaced with NewButton, need to plan for stage 2
15. NewButton - in drafts bundle, need to plan for stage 2 with rename
